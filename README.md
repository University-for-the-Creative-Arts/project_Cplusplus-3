# Project C++ 3

---

## 1. Introduction (≈150 words)

Create a simple C++ AActor that logs messages from different lifecycle functions.

Implement some logic for the following:

- Implement one input action (movement or camera look) using Enhanced Input in C++.
- Expose at least one parameter to Blueprint for tuning.
- Demonstrate it working and explain how it could support another input device (e.g., gamepad or touch).

Explain your reasoning and overall approach  
Outline why this task is relevant or important in a professional or technical context  

---

## 2. Implementation (≈200 words)

- Describe the tools, engine, language, or framework used  
- Explain how you approached the task technically  
- Reference key systems, files, classes, or functions involved  
- Briefly describe any challenges and how they were addressed  

---

## 3. Outcome (≈150 words)

- State what the final result does and how it behaves  
- Confirm that all task requirements have been met  
- Provide a link to a short demonstration video  
- Describe the demonstrated functionality  

**Demonstration video link:**

## 4. Bibliography

- List all external sources used (documentation, tutorials, articles, etc.)  
- Use the universities referencing style

---

## 5. AI Usage Declaration

- State whether AI tools were used or not  
- If used, name the tool(s) and describe how they were used
